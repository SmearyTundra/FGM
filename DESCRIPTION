Description: This package implements an Hybrid Gibbs Sampler strategy for the reference Functional Graphical Model. A simplified version of the model is menageable. It is assumed that the Functional Model is implemented in JAGS, so that this package is capable of providing functions that summarize and manages the output coming from the sampler. Along with the sampler, this package provides useful tools to control the convergence of the chains exploiting coda package, and smoothing utilities in order to perfrom a Bayesian Smoothing. As far as plots of matrices are concerned, the fields package is used.
